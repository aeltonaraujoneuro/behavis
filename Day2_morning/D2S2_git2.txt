# II. Sharing and Collaboration

# Working with remote repos

# create repo "andani_repo" on GIN
# clone remote repo
git clone git@gin.g-node.org:/gindemo/andani_repo
cd andani_repo
git remote -v  # list remotes
ls
cat README
echo "Some info" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add some info"
git status  # shows that we can push to the remote
git push
# go to the repo on GIN and verify that it has been updated


# make changes to the same file locally and remote, fetch and try to merge
# git will ask you to resolve the conflict first



# pull request:

# fork repo "twachtler/demo_data" to "gindemo/demo_data"
# clone the fork
git clone git@gin.g-node.org:/gindemo/demo_data.git
cd demo_data

git branch   # list branches
git branch description   # create new branch
git checkout description    # switch to branch
# add description to README, add, commit
git push -u origin description  # create branch on the upstream repo and push
# go to original repo and create pull request
# after it gets merged:
git checkout master  # leave descripton branch
git push -d origin description  # delete branch after merge
git branch -d description  # delete local branch



# Exercise:
# Create repos on GIN and add a file with a question about git. Give each other access to the repos, fork the repos, write the answer into the file and create a pull request.
